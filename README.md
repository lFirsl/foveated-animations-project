# Foveated Animations in the Context of Crowd Simulations.
This repository holds all the scenes and implementations used for the "Foveated Animations in the Context of Crowd Simulations" paper, written by Florin-Vladimir Stancu within the 2023/24 Academic Year.

## How to run this repository
This project contains a fully fledged out Unity Project, developed on Unity Editor version 2022.3.19f1.

To run this project: 
1. Clone this repository
2. Open up the project from disk by using the Unity Hub
3. Run the project using Unity Editor Version 2022.3.19f1. Alternatively, you may be able to use any 2022.3.* version without facing compatability issues.

Upon loading this project with Unity, you can navigate to the `Assets > Scenes > Basic Scenes` to inspect all the scenes outlined within the project paper, with all necessary scripts attached and pre-set. You may run the scenes as they are, or change the settings of the "Focus Point Sphere" script attached to the "Protagonist" agents in each scene to experience different levels of foveation.

The scenes outside the `Basic Scenes` folder have been used for prototyping older implementations, and have not been used to test our final implementation. They have, however, been left here for prosperity.
